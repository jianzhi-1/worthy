Pear VC Hack 2024 üçê

A visually appealing OpenAI-powered (Realtime, DALL-E, GPT) companion, capable of real-time conversations and emotional reactions. See [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSTgHln8Upg)!

### Set up

#### Installation
First, download Edgeworth sprites by running
```shell
python3 download_gifs.py
python3 gifs_to_frames.py
```

Search for occurrences of `<API_KEY>` in the codebase and replace with your OpenAI API key. Then, run the following shell commands to install the necessary Python and JavaScript libraries.
```shell
pip install openai pygame Flask
cd realtime-backend
npm i
npm start
```
Go to `http://localhost:3000/`, where you will be prompted to enter your `<API_KEY>` for OpenAI's Realtime API access.

#### Running
In three different terminals, start the Realtime API backend (JavaScript), then the emotion state backend (Flask), then the game frontend (pygame).
```shell
cd realtime-backend
npm start
```
You can check the successful running of the backend by going to: `http://localhost:3000`. Note that to run this successfully, you may have to enable some Chrome permissions (microphone access and `Insecure origins treated as secure` in `chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure`: `http://localhost:3000,ws://localhost:8081`).

```shell
python3 emotion_state_backend.py
```
You can check the status of the Flask app by going to: `http://localhost:5000/getEmotion`

```shell
python3 game_frontend.py
```
Note that `game_frontend.py` must be run after `emotion_state_backend.py`. It takes typically around 10 seconds for the game UI to appear.

### Features

1. üé® Amazing graphics and visuals 
You have Edgeworth himself, with his variety of prosecutorial poses. The background is DALL-E generated depending on the context of the conversation (not fully implemented yet). There may be some flickering of the image due to interweaved API calls, but it is minimal.

2. üó£Ô∏è Speech agent (with transcript)
Automatically fulfilled by RealTime API. Guarantees robust performance - allows interruption of the speech agent. The voice is chosen as a variant of `echo`. For best effect, interact with it in a silent room. Sometimes, the latency for response is a bit longer than naturalistic conversations. 

3. ü§® Emotion states and transitions
Edgeworth usually appears reserved, but there are times where he might be "shocked"! Can you find those scenarios? Emotion inference is done through GPT text completion and the transition is done via an API call to the Flask backend. 

### Statistics
The building of the entire application (including the trialling of Realtime APIs, DALL-E image generation, GPT prompting, videoing) took around 7 hours and $17.88 OpenAI credits.
